## Initial
### Create a new repo

Change into the working directory and execute

	git init

This also creates the master branch.

or

	git clone <repo>



### Operations

Generally you want to create a branch to work with.
For a little feature or when working alone it's probably fine to simply create a
new branch

	git checkout -b little-feature
	# make feature..
	# commit it

Switch back to the master

	git checkout master

and merge them

	git merge little-feature


If the master has changed in the meantime it's probably better to use

	git rebase -i master

fist.
